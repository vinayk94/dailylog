<h1>Welcome</h1>

<p>One of my favorite comments on youtube is, <br>
    "Its one of my theories that when people give you advice,  <br>
    they're really just talking to themselves. <br>

    <br>
    While I definitely have nothing to offer as advice, <br> I just want to reflect on few things, <br>
    to digest them and bring some clarity to my thoughts.
