    <p>Well, I guesss its a ill poised question. It needs more conditioning.
If you are consuming to produce something, then its good use of your mental resources and the goods used, otherwise it hurts both yourself and others.</p>

<p>I was of the opinion that we should consume less only to our needs.
But this was when I wasnt producing anything useful to others. This makes me ineligible to have an opionion on consumption.</p>

<p>Now a days, I believe, people should consume more.<br /> 
Should consume more to produce more, and some way it feels like these people move the needle ahead good or bad.<br />
And remember, for evolution to continue, we need to keep moving and choose the best path from the results.</p>

<p>People should use more of GenAI tools to produce what’s on their minds.
People should use energy, to manifest things.</p>

<p>Earlier I had this scarcity mindset that everything is limited. I was blind to the fact that its us who are finding new resources when we are on the verge of the scarcity. Trust the human spirit and do not believe in zero sum games.
Our conservative beliefs will put a cap on our actions and the innovation. <br />
We should be open and keep working.</p>

<p>Although minimal, there is an advantage to having resource constrained mindset too. You dont believe in free lunch and believe in work to earn another day. However, as we discussed above this puts cap on our actions and on what we can do further. This is mid and its not a worse mindset to have.</p>

<p><br />But one should never stoop to the level, where one believes that everything’s gonna stay the way they are currently and that we need not put any effort into this world. This is a very harmful mindset to have and will inhibit you from any action and its very difficult to come out of it.</p>
