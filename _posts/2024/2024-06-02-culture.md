It feels like our ancestors had a common awareness of the importance of freedom and lived everyday to work towards it.
Currently, we live in an age of abundance, it is hard to feel anything other than primal needs, and these have become larger economic activities as we see in the present day world.

It feels like to to feel anything real, to really live a day, where we are willing to work, being aware of the current world is essential. Unless, you know what is needed, you will not try hard enough to collect the truth and work in its framework.
But, looks like, the inability to put effort into any of this, prompts us to live with lies, and we keep saying the same lie to ourselves, until it becomes the truth for you.
