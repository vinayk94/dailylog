My current limitation is target oriented working. <br>
I go awry if I'm not progressing and the deadline is imminnent.<br>
I do not know how to handle, when the wagon stops, like how to proceed and etc.<br>
I mostly slip into other distractions squandering time. <br>
<br>
My innerthoughts says to me that, I'm better off working than hurting myself by wasting time.
That I need to overcome these blocks, but I still cannot handle it.
