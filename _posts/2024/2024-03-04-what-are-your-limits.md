My current limitation is target oriented working. 
I go awry if I'm not progressing and deadline is imminnent.
I do not know how to handle, when the wagon stops, like how to proceed and etc.
I mostly slip into other distractions squandering time. 
My innerthoughts says to me that, I'm better off working than hurting myself by wasting time.
That I need to overcome these blocks, but I still cannot handle it.
