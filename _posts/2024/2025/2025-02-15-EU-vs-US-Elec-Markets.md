The European and U.S. electricity markets have evolved with **different regulatory, operational, and market structures**. This document explores the **intricacies of the EU electricity system**, detailing **market operations, redispatching, regulatory constraints, and pricing mechanisms**, followed by a **detailed comparison with the U.S. system**.

## **The European Electricity Market: Structure and Operations**

### **Market Structure and Entities**
The European electricity market consists of multiple **independent national Transmission System Operators (TSOs) and Power Exchanges (PXs)**. Unlike the U.S., where ISOs/RTOs manage both market clearing and grid operations, **Europe separates market trading from grid operations**.

#### **Key Market Entities in Europe**

| Entity                           | Role                                                               | Example                      |
|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| **Power Exchanges (PXs)**        | Run **day-ahead and intraday markets**, clear trades             | EPEX Spot, Nord Pool, OMIE   |
| **Transmission System Operators (TSOs)** | Ensure **grid reliability**, perform **redispatching**, manage **cross-border flows** | RTE (France), TenneT (Germany), National Grid ESO (UK) |
| **Market Coupling Mechanism**    | Optimizes cross-border trading                                   | EUPHEMIA Algorithm           |
| **Balancing Market Operators**   | Handle **real-time imbalances**                                  | TSOs & separate BSPs (Balancing Service Providers) |

### **Operations Timeline in Europe**

| **Stage**                      | **Who Runs It?**                 | **What Happens?**                                    | **Constraints Considered?**                           |
|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| **Day-Ahead Market (DAM)**     | PXs (EPEX Spot, Nord Pool)     | Market clearing **via EUPHEMIA algorithm**, setting prices | **Cross-border transmission limits only** (no intra-zone constraints) |
| **Intraday Market (IDM)**      | PXs (Continuous & Auction)     | Adjustments to trades **closer to real-time**      | **No intra-zone constraints**                        |
| **Redispatching**              | TSOs                           | Adjust generator schedules **to fix congestion**   | **Intra-zonal congestion fixed after market clearing** |
| **Balancing Market (Real-Time Dispatch)** | TSOs | **Correct real-time deviations in generation/load** | **TSOs activate balancing reserves**                |

### **Trading Blocks and Settlement in European Balancing Markets**
The **balancing markets in Europe** operate with **specific trading blocks and settlement mechanisms** to ensure real-time stability.

| **Market Segment**                        | **Timeframe** | **Who Participates?**            | **Payment Structure**                                |
|-------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **Frequency Containment Reserves (FCR)**  | Seconds      | Pre-qualified generators, demand response | Availability + activation payment |
| **Automatic Frequency Restoration Reserves (aFRR)** | 5-15 min  | Generators, flexible loads      | Capacity payment + energy activation payment |
| **Manual Frequency Restoration Reserves (mFRR)** | 15-30 min | Generators, storage, demand response | Bids cleared in merit order + activation payment |
| **Replacement Reserves (RR)**             | 30+ min      | Large-scale power plants, interconnectors | Clearing price mechanism |

âœ… **Balancing markets operate under pre-contracted capacity payments and real-time activation payments.**  
âœ… **TSOs procure reserves based on system needs, ensuring grid stability.**

## **Redispatching in Europe: Why It Exists and How It Works**
Europe operates on **zonal pricing** rather than **nodal pricing** (used in the U.S.). PXs clear markets **only considering cross-border constraints**, but **do not account for intra-zonal transmission congestion**.

| **Problem**                                      | **Solution in EU (Redispatching)**                 | **Alternative in U.S. (Nodal Pricing)**               |
|-------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Market clearing ignores intra-zone congestion  | TSOs redispatch generators post-market clearing | Market clearing **includes all constraints upfront** |
| Generation schedules may be infeasible          | TSOs instruct **some plants to reduce output, others to increase** | Nodal prices **automatically reflect congestion** |
| Increases costs for consumers                   | Costs are **socialized via grid tariffs**       | Costs are **borne by congestion-causing participants** |

âœ… **Redispatching allows TSOs to fix congestion problems.**  
ðŸš¨ **It is an extra step that would be unnecessary if nodal pricing was used.**

## **U.S. Electricity Market: Structure and Efficiency (Example: ERCOT)**
ERCOT (Electric Reliability Council of Texas) operates under a **fully deregulated, real-time market structure** with no capacity market.

### **Trading Blocks and Settlement in ERCOT's Balancing Market**

| **Market Segment**                  | **Timeframe**  | **Who Participates?**      | **Payment Structure**                           |
|-------------------------------------|--------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **Day-Ahead Market (DAM)**         | 1 day ahead  | Generators, loads, traders | Cleared market price                         |
| **Real-Time Market (RTM)**         | 5-15 min     | Online generators, flexible demand | Locational Marginal Pricing (LMP)  |
| **Ancillary Services (AS)**        | 1 hour to real-time | Pre-qualified generators | Availability + deployment payment           |
| **Fast Frequency Response (FFR)**  | Seconds to minutes | Batteries, demand response | Capacity payment + energy payment            |

âœ… **ERCOT does not use a capacity market; instead, it relies on real-time scarcity pricing.**  
âœ… **All constraints are included in SCUC/SCED, avoiding the need for redispatching.**

---

## **Summary:**
âœ… **Nodal pricing includes transmission constraints, ensuring congestion is priced into LMPs.**  
âœ… **Market and grid operations are integrated within ISOs, reducing complexity.**  
ðŸš¨ **Europe relies on redispatching because market clearing does not consider intra-zonal constraints.**  
ðŸš¨ **Future European reforms may push toward nodal pricing to improve efficiency.**
