It's been more than a month since I have been here and I feel am meeting people who are the most confident with the least information possible, or  I would rather call it misinformation.

I don't understand why we stopped being honest with ourselves. If there is any quality that I would strongly suggest to be instilled among the children, i.e., to be honest with oneself. It saves time and makes us aware of the ongoing things. It takes practice and can easily be washed away by the environment in which we are exposed.

Maybe it's the incentives that have changed. Looks like conformity and following the path already laid out by others whom we consider as successful is forcing us to stop having any thoughts and rather blindly act on the same path to reap the immediate benefits.

But what is the use of such a benefit? At least for me, the whole concept of work in the current world (where the per unit amount of work needed to earn a livelihood is reducing every day), is to experience the act rather than the reward. The reward is a one-time thing, which we mostly squander on materialistic things that have very short-term utility. 
But, the experience helps you with your internal model of the world, and there comes a new circumstance in your life, you can build on your experience to act on it. But, looks like it is not the case, especially among the people that am with. Guess, it varies a lot, some value reward, some value experience.

For example, consider a simple work archetype like doing your assignments, where you need to collect/ research some material to support a few arguments in the class. This kind of exercise forces you to work on your own, validate the collected information, and collate it for the arguments. However, you think your time is so valuable that you give such an assignment to others by paying them, assuming that you have a much higher opportunity cost. I can understand this if you are using your time to build something else in the meantime, but you are mostly doing some manual work, where your replacement can be found in no time. I don't at all get it.

Now, imagine you take up a job, that asks you to come up with a solution, guess what kind of mental exercise you would have to go through, the same class exercise that I have described earlier. If you skip this in your teenage and twenties, I'm afraid you will never have any critical thinking, and will mostly come to decisions by analogies, in which case, you are heavily dependent on your circle. <br>
--- So why is such short-term thinking being encouraged?

Also, these people in the early 20's are the ones, who I observed to have this strong inclination to subscribe to some kind of philosophy. At a very tender age, when they can formulate their understanding of the world, they are dying to subscribe to some idealogy, some kind of reduced-order understanding of the world. 

Is it their inability to put some effort into understanding the world around them, that is pushing them to close their eyes and blindly follow others? 

I think writing helps me to be honest at least with me. Produce more while being honest with oneself. Honesty leads you to the truth and acting on via production helps you evolve.
