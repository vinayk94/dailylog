What shapes our capacity for understanding - both ourselves and others? I've been wrestling with this question after observing how differently people respond to others facing struggles they once experienced themselves. Sometimes, those who have "made it" show the least empathy for others still finding their way.

There is no objective definition of wealth. For me, wealth is measured by how many times I've tried and failed at things. Not in terms of accomplishments, but rather in the integral of action across my trials over time. That's the only real wealth. This insight emerged after reflecting on how we often shield ourselves or others from potential failure, not realizing what we might be losing in the process.

Sometimes I wonder: what if we had taken a predetermined path? Would that have led to a better position?

At a fundamental level, I believe it's our duty to ourselves to put effort into knowing ourselves better. When we stay on a predetermined path without exposing ourselves to various experiences, we never truly discover which character we might develop into. Instead, we mask our weaknesses with our successful qualities.

Yes, a predetermined path might lead to better outcomes in conventional metrics like finances. But is that all life is about? How do we know how we'd react to different situations?

Even if two people start from the same place, without exposure to experiences that reveal their true nature, there wouldn't be much behavioral learning over time - except what comes from external incentives like their predetermined position. We might assume that two people who struggled in their early years would naturally sympathize with others in similar situations as they grow older. But there's no guarantee of this, because without self-knowledge, they may judge others based on their current motives rather than objective circumstances. It's only through trying and failing that we truly come to know ourselves.

The paradox is clear - in our attempt to create the perfect path, we might be limiting our capacity for growth, empathy, and true self-understanding. Perhaps real development comes not from avoiding life's challenges, but from facing them consciously and learning who we are in the process.
