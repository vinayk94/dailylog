Most often the question that I stumble upon is what am I ? <br>
Our earlier definition of what we do, what career we get into, what possessions we secure and so on. <br>
But, more and more,it occurs to me that, we are what we are honest about. <br>
Unless, we are honest about something, we can't think new, we cant act new, and we are just those who chose to clones of others.<br>
How can we expect to know the truth of anything, unless we are honest about it ? It goes without saying that finding new information, learning something new, creating something new, requires effort. But, even to make ourselves conducive to effort, we need to be honest with ourselves.<br>
<br>
I really do not understand a culture, where people are being encouraged to go for less effort more return paths. I just cant fathom that one could really learn, understand and experience truth, if they didn't care to put effort into it. I wonder how many lives this culture would be creating, where a person is capped to have a limited set of experiennces in life and worse, they are already predetermined. 
<br>
<br>
Can you call it a life if you are on a determined path ? If so, what would you use the fruits of this deterministic life for ? Would you invest that again into a determined investment ?  I guess so, because, as you never chose something with uncertainty, you never learn or have the experience /courage to move ahead with less knowledge. If you are participating in this perpetual determinsitic world, what are you doing ? and hence the question **WHAT ARE YOU ?** Are you a bot, if so for whom ? <br>
<br>
Can a culture add any true information to the world if it lives in a deterministic world ? If we expand, a culture's information contribution manifests in their value to the world. If we look at the saturated or declining economies of once developed nations, this becomes clearer. They wanted to do things in a deterministic way, looking for security or feelings of others, and hence, could not create something of value to external world in the past decades . They stopped being honest with the true state of their nations, and now it is leading to a question of their existence?<br>
<br>

If a culture promotes a deterministic world, in no time, they stop being honest with themselves and will cease being relevant to others. Thats the cost of honesty, for a country, for a culture, and for a person.

<br>
<br>
It feels such a waste of time, if we are not daring to experience anything truly and am afraid that our time will be gone, before we are honest about anything in life.<br>

When I look at some of the best directions, watch best acting, read and hear best music, it makes me so humble that they were able to create something truly new that didn't exist before. And most often, these people speak very honestly about it. They do not care about others opinions. They just wanted to express themselves.
They just wanted to create something, which they have been having real feelings/thoughts and expressed themselves, by going to any extent to stay true to themselves.<br>

It is such a surreal experience to watch someone expressly truly, be it cinema, music, technology etc.<br>
I wonder, if something like this could be created if they were not honest with themselves. <br>
They are their honesty...


A man's life is just a dot product of his honesty dimension and other areas of life.<br>
A person like Grigori Perelman is honest with maths and he is a mathematician. <br>
Generally, a person is more inclined to be honest with his family and that may be the reason, older people stress upon family when asked what's important in life. It could be that, its the real experience that moves us, as it uncovers some unique and mostly true information. We can experience something for real only when we are honest, Otherwise, we are just trying to imitate the feelings published by others. E.g. trying to experience something at a place just because some one posted it on social media. <br>
