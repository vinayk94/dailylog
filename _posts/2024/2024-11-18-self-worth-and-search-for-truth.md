Self-worth, I believe, is fundamental to how we function as individuals and as a society. It's not something that can be given to us by others - it must come from within. The issue with seeking worth externally is that it makes us dependent on others' validation, creating a fragile ego that needs constant feeding.

True self-worth grows when we push our boundaries and accomplish things we thought were beyond us. It's like expanding our span in linear algebra - we increase our capacity to handle life's challenges. This internal growth is far more valuable than any external validation.

I see this pattern in many places - where we've somehow convinced generations that material wealth is the primary validator of life. The result? We have people in their 60s who are physically healthy but mentally stagnant. They haven't learned anything new in 30 years because learning would challenge their ego.

What deeply concerns me is seeing fathers who have given up on their own lives, merely existing day to day. They've lost their spirit and rely solely on their ego and validation from others, often demanding respect for trivial things. I wonder what makes a person so hopeless that they need to hurt others just to feel some sense of power to get through their day. I believe it comes down to self-worth - if you have enough internal worth, you won't need to rely on others to live your life.


Life and work teach us certain truths as we progress. If your mindset remains unchanged despite aging, it likely means you haven't engaged with real challenges or allowed yourself to learn. When I see elderly people still measuring life purely through material wealth, caught up in spite and jealousy, it suggests they never worked on anything contributing to collective good.

Most people I've worked with in science and industry share a humbling quality - they believe in greater causes. They pay taxes because they believe in their country, they strive for transparency in science because they believe in humanity's collective progress. To reach this understanding, you naturally learn that spite, jealousy, and material wealth matter less than truth.

But we can't force people toward collective good - that only pushes them away. The care for truth must come from within. You discover what matters through your own journey. When you find yourself running in circles, making the same mistakes repeatedly, you realize you need to find truth. And to find truth, you need to humble yourself.

Looking at Indian civilization, I wonder how a culture that produced the Vedas and Bhagavad Gita, that understood human internal struggles so deeply, could lose its way. This makes me realize that perhaps truth alone is not enough - it must be paired with continuous work and enhancement, regardless of age. I see this in someone like Daniel Booth, a pioneer, who taught his daughter to fight and continued working and contributing until his final days. I respect him deeply for embodying this principle of constant growth and contribution.

This makes me wonder - if we had found a way to efficiently transmit not just knowledge but also the drive to work and enhance it, would evolution have needed so many years? It's no coincidence that humanity has evolved so dramatically in the last 400 years - it's because of the spread of science and the challenges it set for itself. Science provides both the knowledge and the framework for continuing to build upon it.

Between birth and death, I believe our only real wealth is our self-worth, measured by our net contribution to any living being besides ourselves. In our final moments, its hard to believe that we would be thinking about that extra house we could have bought.

Parents today have a crucial role - nurturing self-worth in their children is perhaps the greatest wealth they can pass on. How we react to insults, handle self-doubt, approach problems, navigate careers, take risks - everything stems from self-worth. While we might falter often, having this center helps us reorient ourselves. Without it, we risk flowing wherever the wind takes us, which is fine in the right environment but dangerous in unproductive ones.

Our internal measuring system for genuine self-worth is remarkably accurate. I've observed that many who are absurdly wealthy yet lack true self-worth are often the most insecure, constantly seeking validation. Meanwhile, others know they could rebuild if they lost everything. The poor often have well-calibrated self-worth because they directly see how their work feeds their families.

The only way to build genuine self-worth is through constant self-improvement and contribution. When I see an 80-year-old grandmother from Illinois paragliding on her birthday, dancing, working, and cherishing life, I see someone whose joy comes from confidence in herself and her intrinsic worth. That's the kind of wealth we should all strive to build.
