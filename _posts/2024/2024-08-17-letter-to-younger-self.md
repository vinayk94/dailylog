Do not waste your youth. Its the only time you can afford to learn to be truly honest with yourself. Otherwise, we will lead a life, where we have to settle on some lie, just to be able to move on with life. Like if you think you know something, we need to question ourselves, if we really are capable of facing and acting on it. Believe it or not, it becomes really hard to be honest with oneself as we grow, as the later stages of human life mostly srvives on ego and we cant afford to believe anything which hurts our ego.

If you are in 20's, then we are left with another 30-45 years of life with a subset of it where our brain functions at optimal level. If our lives are such a short term events, then we need to question ourselves, if we want to fill it with lies fuelled by our ego, or with the truth.

Do not be apprehensive about hardships. There is really no way of really knowing anything without hardship. Knowledge and understanding requires disposing our old knowledge and filling ourselves with new knowledge. Almost every activity which has to deal with overcoming our current knowledge involves work. Hardships are the best opportunities one can have to getter nearer to the best approximations of truth of any system. Do not be afraid of them and waste your life taking shortcuts.

Do not be so afraid of life. There might be many instances where you feel so overwhelmed that you think its the end of it. Nope, in fact life is brutal and it expects you to ovecome all of it and we have to live longer than what we estimate. If you are curious, life is actually beautiful.


There might be many timees you might feel the need for peace. It is hard to define what peace means for a person. From the higher level, it could be due to our runninng from something in the past or running for something in future. Both of these are functions of our current information. So, it can only solved by being absolutely honest in trying to understand our state and also our state in the world. Only honesty helps with discovering new information.

Our culture doesnot allow nurturing the confidence in taking risks, even in people having enough age and resources. It thinks that confidence comes from accumulation of material wealth. It fails to realize that confidence in a human comes from work and working to your full capacities.

I want to work to know my limitations better. I use work as a tool, what I can do and what I cannot. To be aware of what I feel strongly about. 

I have only near about half life left and I dont want to lead this life, in dealing with lies, by believing some one else's fake version of the world. I want to understand it by myself and I believe, I cannot unless you work. Better not be pleased with anything except for truth and justice.

I dont care about saving anyone's/family's name, when the families are still having dog fights for that last piece of meat, despite having their stomachs filled. These idiots struggle to find any use for their life other than gourging things. As someone said, it is no measure of health, when one adjusts to a sick society. I aint looking for any validation from people who are not aware of their place/responsibility in the world.

I believe, sometimes, humans fail to understand the marginal value of money once they become better off. Since they dont have any relative measure to work against, they peter about the smallest, petty things and blow it out of proportions. And for these reasons, I firmly believe, I better be identifying challenges for myself in order to not fall into these crappy traps.
